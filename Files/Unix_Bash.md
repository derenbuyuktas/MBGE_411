### Opening a Terminal

Opening a terminal is easy but will differ from system to system. Below are a few places to start looking depending on which system you are on.

- On a Linux machine you will find it in `Applications -> System or Applications -> Utilities`.
- On a Mac you will find it under `Applications -> Utilities`.
- On a Windows machine the terminal is called a command prompt and you can find this under `Start -> Program Files -> Accessories -> Command Prompt`. However, Windows does not have a native bash shell so in Windows 10 you will need to separately install [Bash](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-install-bash-shell-command-line-windows-10) or if you are using an older version of windows you will need to install an external SSH client. [Putty](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) or [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/install.html) are rather good ones.
